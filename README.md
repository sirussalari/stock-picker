# stock-picker

This project is an assignment part of the Odin Project curriculum.

This simple program consists of a single function that takes a single argument which is supposed to be an array of numbers.

The purpose and function of the program is to take a list of numbers and return a pair of indicies that yields the biggest differerence between the corresponding numbers in the array, where the bigger number has to come after the smaller number.

The idea is to simulate a stock-picker, where the elements in the array represent a stock price for a particular day, and each index in the array is one day (starting at day 0).
